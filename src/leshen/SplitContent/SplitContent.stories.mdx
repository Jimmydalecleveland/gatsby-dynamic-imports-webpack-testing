              Because it would be very cumbersome in the CMS Editing Interface
              to have to set which side your picture and content are on whenever
              you drag items around, the system auto alternates side by side
              content. In this instance the `prominent` property has been added
              to show the boundaries between sections, but alternating
              background colors are usually set within the global styles of a
              site&apos;s theme.

## Align image to bottom for cropped images

              Ryan has no legs below the thigh, and so we had to align him to
              the bottom of this section, which requires the padding of the
              entire section to be removed from the bottom and placed within
              this content area. Merely passing `alignImageToBottom` to this
              component will take care of all that work. It is quite lovely,
              when you think about it.
